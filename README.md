## 🏡 Day 7: ML Mini Project — House Price Prediction (Regression)

Built an end-to-end regression model for predicting house prices using real estate listings data.

### 🔨 Key Steps:
- ✅ Data cleaning, missing value imputation, type conversion
- ✅ Feature engineering (floor, carpet area, amount parsing)
- ✅ Label encoding & scaling
- ✅ Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree & Random Forest
- ✅ Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
- ✅ Best model: **Random Forest Regressor**

## 📌 Tech Stack
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest, Ridge, Lasso)
- GridSearchCV, classification_report, confusion_matrix, cross_val_score
